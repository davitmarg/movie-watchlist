# OMDB Movie Watchlist App

This is a simple, single-page React application for keeping track of movies you want to watch. It uses the OMDB API to search for movies and stores your watchlist in the browser's memory.

This project was built as a school assignment and follows a "modlet" (modular component) file structure.

## Features

- **Search Movies:** Find any movie from the OMDB database using the search popup.
- **Add to Watchlist:** Instantly add a movie from the search results to your personal watchlist.
- **Mark as Watched:** Click the checkmark icon (✓) to remove a movie from your list, "marking" it as watched.
- **Single List:** The app is simplified to manage one single, persistent watchlist.

## Tech Stack

- React (using Create React App)
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules (for component-scoped styling)
- OMDB API (for movie data)
